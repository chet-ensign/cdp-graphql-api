== Introduction

Today, virtually all business is at some point digital, and the number of systems involved and the set of data collected is growing rapidly.
Each new system creates new silos of customer data, spreading sensitive data across both organizational and geographical borders.

Even the digital savvy businesses struggle to control and utilize this information.
Businesses and users also rely on such data to be accessible in real-time, and at scale - for instance to deliver personalizations.
Additionally businesses now face severe legal charges if customer data is not treated according to regulatory requirements (ref GDPR).

The Context Server (CXS) specification aims to standardize exchange of customer data across systems and silos.
This enables centralization of customer data - consequently giving control of the data back to the business, and the customers.

The CXS standard builds upon four core concepts: Profiles, Events, Consents, and Clients

  * Profiles represent each individual "customer". Aggregating and tracking all registered properties, including which system actually collected the data.
  * Events represent user behavioral data / interactions performed by a customer (aka profile). A purchase, or a simple click on a link represents different events.
  * Consents are actual permission given by a customer to the organization, with a limited scope and duration
  * Clients represent the various systems that provide and/or consume data from a Context Server, typical clients are: CRM systems, Analytics, Content Management Systems, E-commerce systems etc.

Alongside the CXS standard, an open source reference implementation called Apache UNOMI has been developed.
UNOMI provides a high-performance and scalable implementation of CXS that enables deployment in your organization today.

The CXS standard is defined as a web-based API, through the self-documenting and strongly typed GraphQL syntax.

It has been an explicit goal of the CXS committee to allow extensive customization of CXS deployments, in order to fit the need of each different organization.
As such, the API dynamically evolves as you add custom property-, event-, and consent-types to your deployment.

== Domain Model
This chapter describes the entities of the CXS domain model, and how they relate

=== Profiles
Profiles is in many ways what CXS is about. A Context Server dynamically build profiles from events that occur over time.

A Profile can be created from an anonymous visitor on a webpage, or populated from an identity system or maybe a CRM - or the combination of all of them.

<<Clients>> (or origins?) like a CMS, CRM or Identity system can be setup to feed <<Events>> to the context server.
The client is responsible for uniqely identifying users, for instance with a cookie in the CMS, a customer ID in the CRM or a user ID in the Identity server.
The context server will then build profiles based on the provided identifiers.

A profile is made up of the following:

<<Properties>> in the key-value format containing basic data values such as an e-mail, name, date of birth etc.
What properties are available is configured through a global set of <<Property Types>>.

The following fields are mandatory for any CXS implementation:

* ProfileIDs (list of IDs associated with this profile)
* Events (access events associated with this profile)
* Segments (access segment this profile is associated with)
* Interests (Scored list of topics the profile is interested in)
* Lists (Lists the profile is active in)
* Consents (Consents given by the profile)
* Properties (Stored and searchable data properties for the profile)

TODO: More??

=== ProfilePropertyType

To control what properties can be set for a given instance of a Context Server, a list of property types are globally defined.
A ProfilePropertyType consists of the following:
* Name (a Globally unique name for the instance)
* Type (Identifying the value it stores: Identifier, String, Int, Float, Date, Boolean, GeoPoint or Set. Sets hold a new list of properties)

The objective of ProfilePropertyTypes is to consistently collect data from different sources into profiles. For instance a field called "Date of birth" in one system might be known as "Born" in another.
In the context server these fields are forced to map to a specific property, or may simply be ignored.

TODO: Mapping from clients?

=== Events
Events are what drives the Context Server forward.
A Context Server is specifically only interested in "User behaviour events". This could be anything from someone clicking a link, to performing a transaction or consenting to use of his/hers information.
Events are delivered from specified <<Clients>> to the Context Server.

TODO
Imagine an e-commerce site with a client that collect events from site visitors.
When you are browsing the site with your laptop, the client assigns a cookie to your browser and starts feeding events to the CXS API.
As you click on some product links, and maybe fill in a form that includes your e-mail. CXS will gradually populate your profile.
Then later, you pick up your mobile device and go back to the site. A new cookie is generated, and a new profile starts to build up.

At some point, data gathered from the different profiles may intersect, i.e. if the same e-mail is registered for multiple profiles.
In such cases, a profile merge might occur.

When profiles are merged, one of the existing profile will be selected as master, and any existing information from the "slave" profile merged into the master.
Both profile ID's are retained, so data can still be collected through the ID stored in the existing cookies.


=== Eventttypes

TODO

=== Consents

As new laws regarding use of personal data such as GDPR arrive,
Consents are inherently more important to ensure you are using and storing data in compliance with policies.

Consents consist of the following fields:

* Token (TODO)
* Type (TODO)
* Status
* StatusDate
* revokeDate
* Events
* Profile

=== Personas

Personas is first and foremost a concept used by marketeers to visualize their target customers.

In CXS, personas are basically "mockup" profiles with the primary purpose of testing or emulating what will happen with a real profile that matches the persona.
For instance what a personalization in a CMS or a newsletter might look like.

Personas are (as oppose to profiles) can be explicitly defined, where real profiles are dynamically generated.

=== Lists

Lists are explicitly created and named. Profiles may then be added to a list, and opt out if desired.
Whenever a profile opts out of a list, that information will also be stored - so the profile is never accidentally added back to the list at a later point.

A common use-case for lists is creating a list for a given campaign, and add the target profiles to the list as the campaign starts.

=== Segments

Segments are similar to lists in that profiles may be in the segment or not.
However, where profiles are explicitly added to lists, they are dynamically added to segments based on events that occur.

Administrative users define segments based on <<Filters>>.

Example segments:
* Rich europeans: Profiles in Europe with income above €100k
* Frequent buyer: Profiles that have completed more than 5 transactions in the last 3 months
* Etc TODO

=== Topics

Topics represent the core entities of the business running the Context Server.
The Context Server aims to find correlation between profiles and the topics.
When such correlations are identified, it is called <<Interests>>.

CXS Administrators need to maintain a list of topics in order to obtain profile interests.
Profile interests is typically a core objective of Marketing activities, and targeting users with better content.

Example Topics for a car manufacturer might for instance be:
* "Model S"
* "Model 3"
* "Model X"

TODO: Topic identifiers?

=== interests

Whenever the Context server registers events that match between a profile and topic, this will boost a profiles interest for the specific Topic.
A profiles interest in a specific topic is measured in 0-1, where 1 is maximum. As such 0,5 would indicate a higher interest than 0,35.

How a context server identifies interest, and scores it is implementation specific - but for any meaningful implementation interest will automatically decrease with time if no new events occur.

Example interests for products from a car manufacturer might be:
* Model S = 0.1
* Model 3 = 0.3
* Model X = 0.9

=== Filters

TODO

=== Scopes

Scopes provide an efficient way of grouping administrative objects in the context server.
Profiles and events are stored globally, but marketing activities might often be different from region to region, or in the various branches of a business.

As such <<Lists>>, <<Segments>>, TODO are all placed in scopes to reduce administrative mayhem.

=== Clients

Since the Context Server holds sensitive data, it should not be exposed publicly on the internet.

Clients are "software" components that are allowed to talk to the Context Server.
A client may both read and write data to the Context Server, but most commonly a client passes events to the Context Server.

Client must be registered and authorized in order to access the context server.

TODO: We probably need to separate client vs source? What happens with web collector client that is running on 10 different sites? Do we have a "sourceID" concept, ala siteID in GA?

== API

CXS defines a standard API through the use of GraphQL.

The CXS GraphQL API should not be made publically available, but only exposed to specific authorized clients.
The logic behind this is that the CXS API itself does not limit access to data (TODO)

Examples of clients are: An event collector for your website, a client that performs integration with your CRM etc.
