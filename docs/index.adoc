== Introduction

Today, virtually all business is at some point digital, and the number of systems involved and the set of data collected is growing rapidly.
Each system creates new silos of customer data, spreading sensitive and personal data across both organizational and geographical borders.

Even digital savvy businesses struggle to control and utilize this information.
Businesses and users also rely on such data to be accessible in real-time, and at scale - for instance to deliver personalizations.
Additionally businesses now face severe legal charges if customer data is not treated according to regulatory requirements (ref GDPR).

The Customer Data Platform (CDP) specification aims to standardize exchange of customer data across systems and silos.
This enables centralization of customer data - consequently giving control of the data back to the business, and the customers.

The CDP standard builds upon four core concepts: Profiles, Events, Consents, and Clients

  * Profiles represent each individual "customer". Aggregating and tracking all registered properties, including which system actually collected the data.
  * Events represent user behavioral data / interactions performed by a customer (aka profile). A purchase, or a simple click on a link represents different events.
  * Consents are actual permission given by a customer to the organization, with a limited View and duration
  * Clients represent the various systems that provide and/or consume data from a Customer Data Platform, typical clients are: CRM systems, Identity Systems, Content Management Systems, E-commerce etc.

The CDP standard is defined as a web-based API using GraphQL - providing a self-documented and strongly typed interface.

It has been an explicit goal of the CXS committee to allow extensive customization of CDP deployments, in order to fit the need of each different organization.
As such, the API dynamically evolves as you customize your deployment.

== Use Cases

In this section we present a few use cases that are relevant to the scope covered by the CDP specification. They are by
no means exhaustive and serve primarly as illustrations of what may be achieved using servers that implement the
standard.

=== Personalization

The first and most common use case is the case of delivering personalized experiences on (desktop or mobile) web sites.

image::images/cdp-webpersonalization-usecase.svg["Personalization use case diagram"]

As illustrated above, the browser can interact with both a Content Management System (CMS) and a CDP-compliant server
to first retrieve the HTML needed to deliver the page content. After this the next request to the CMS is a request
for personalized content that will be customized based on the profile retrieved from the CDP. The result is personalized
content for the current visitor being sent back to the browser.

This illustration is by no means the only way to implement personalization using a CDP but it serves as a simple
introduction to the possibilies such a system may offer.

=== Newsletters

This use case is relevant to users interested in delivering newsletters to the proper audience. For example it might be
interesting to send a newsletter to promote a product to a group of profiles that has not purchased the product before,
but it would not be a good idea to send it to people that have already purchased it.

image::images/cdp-newsletter-usecase.svg["Newsletter use case diagram"]

In the above illustration the newsletter server can query the CDP for a group of profile using either a query or a pre-
defined segment to retrieve the subset of profiles it is interested in. Once those profiles are retrieved they may be
used to update the newsletters management system lists with information coming from those exported profiles. And finally,
when the newsletter is ready to be distributed, the updated lists may be used to send the emails using an email delivery
server.

=== Privacy

Privacy is a very important topic, especially when dealing with visitor data. For example, new legislation such as the
https://eugdpr.org[GDPR] imposes strict restrictions on how visitor data collection should be processed. It is therefore
very important that the CDP specification provide standardized ways of complying with more and more stringent
requirements.

image::images/cdp-privacy-usecase.svg["Privacy use case diagram"]

In the above use case we illustrate the support of consent management that is available in CDP-compliant systems. A
visitor profile may store the state of consents (granted or not) and these may be updated by using specialized event
types.

Other use cases for privacy include profile downloading, being able to anonymize visitor data, as well as deleting
profiles.

=== A/B testing

CDP systems may also be used to deliver A/B testing experiences. In this use case, the CDP server will use the visitor
profile information by updating it with the variants that the visitor has been exposed to, effectively "classifying" the
visitor into a sub-group.

image::images/cdp-abtesting-usecase.svg["A/B testing use case diagram"]

In the above illustration, this use case is implemented by using a CMS to deliver the different variants of content that
are hidden by default. After that, the CDP is asked whether the profile is in variant A or B, which might be implemented
in different fashions but they will be remembered by the CDP for future displays.

== API Reference

The Customer Data Platform (CDP) standard is built around a set of concepts, domain objects and services for interacting with them.
This is represented through a strongly typed API defined through GraphQL Types, Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions.

This chapter describes the API in detail.

NOTE: The most efficient way to expore the GraphQL API is by starting the sample CDP server TODO

*Scalars*

GraphQL provides several basic value types that are used extensively in this specification, for instance Int and String.
However, the CDP specification is also handling other value types in a similar fashion. As such, the following scalars have been added:

[source,graphql]
----
include::{sourcedir}/schemas/cdpglobal.js[lines=5..16]
----

=== Clients

The CDP GraphQL API is not intended to be exposed publicly, but only made accessible to specific authorized clients.

Client means any software that interacts directly with the Customer Data Platform.
A Customer Data Platform typically holds personal data, as such implementers are urged to place strong control over which clients can connect to a Customer Data Platform.
In any case, it should not be possible for unauthorized clients to access the Customer Data Platform API.

Examples of clients are:

* Cookie-based tracker for website(s)
* Integration with your CRM
* Integration with your Identity System

Each Client is responsible for uniquely identifying visitors, for instance through the use of a cookie on the website, a customer ID in the CRM or a user ID in the Identity system.
The Customer Data Platform requires <<profileIDs>> to be unique within every client.
For instance, if a client is used to track visitors across multiple websites, it should aim to re-use the same profileID across all of them, for the same visitor.

NOTE: The standard does not specify Queries or Mutations for creating or retrieving Clients in the CDP specification, as this is considered an implementation-specific feature.
For any CDP implementation, a Client must be pre-defined in the CDP server before it can access the API.

NOTE: Queries, mutations and subscriptions for Clients are not defined by the standard, and as such implementation specific

----
include::{sourcedir}/schemas/client.js[lines=2..6]
----


=== Sources
Sources are used to secure unique identifier per client.
For instance, if a CRM is used as a source it will have unique identifiers for its respective profile records.
As the CDP server collects data from multiple records, the combination of source and identifier provides a globally unique, but consistent identifier for CDP to process.

=== Profiles
Profiles are in many ways the essence of CDP.
A Customer Data Platform dynamically builds profiles from events that occur over time.

A Profile can be created from an anonymous visitor on a webpage, or populated from an identity system or maybe a CRM - or the combination of all of them.

Different <<Clients>> like a website tracking script, CRM or identity system can be configured to feed <<Events>> to the Customer Data Platform.

The Customer Data Platform is responsible for building profiles based on the provided identifiers and the stream of events coming from each Client.

NOTE: Profiles are not created like many other objects, but are rather composed through a chain of events.

NOTE: Specification implementers are encouraged to implement interfaces for importing profilesSchema??

=== Properties

A Property is essentially data stored in a key-value format.
A single property can hold a single value, or an array of values.
Each property has a specific valueType to limit what kind of values it may hold.
These are ``Identifier``,``String``, ``Int``, ``Float``, ``Date``, ``Boolean``, ``GeoPoint`` and ``Set``.

Some example properties:

* someString : "Serge"
* someDate : "1996-12-19"
* someInteger : 1337
* location : "lat,lon"
* arrayOfStrings : ["This", "is", "nice"]
* setOfProperties : {prompt : "hello", response : "yo"}

The valueType Set is special, as it enables nested properties and a tree-structure of properties.
I.e. from the example above: "setOfProperties.response" would hold the value "yo"

Properties are defined by a PropertyType.
PropertyTypes are used to dynamically define schemas in the Customer Data Platform.
A propertyType essentially specifies:

* the property name
* the valueType of the property (Identifier, String, Int, Float, Date, Boolean, GeoPoint and Set)
* minimum occurences of values (a property may hold one or more values)
* maximum occurences

Since the CDP api is defined using GraphQL,
the API is dynamically updated when the propertyTypes are changed.

ID:: must be in a format that's acceptable as a GraphQL field name (/[_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*/) , and we recommend to prefix it to avoid conflicts, i.e acme_pageView, acme_click. "cdp_" is reserved.
minOccurences:: Default = 0. For minOccurrences > 1 the property can hold multiple values in preserved order. minOccurences = 1 indicates the property is mandatory.
maxOccurences:: Default = 1. maxOccurences = 0 indicates no limit. maxOccurences must be higher than minOccurences.
tags:: TODO: User generated tags.
systemTags:: TODO: address, social.
personalData:: Default = true.


==== CDP_PropertyInput

This type is a workaround for missing inheritance in GraphQL.

=== ProfileProperties

To create a schema for <<Profiles>>, we need a globally defined set of properties.

Collectively, all ProfileProperties defines the schema of properties that can be used by any profile in the Customer Data Platform.

This enables administrators and developers to build and maintain a consistent data model for profiles across different <<Clients>>.
Any data imported to the system must be mapped to a corresponding ProfileProperties.

==== CDP_ProfileProperties

Profiles are normally updated through events.
The history of external or internal profile modifications is accessible through the profile update events.
CDP must also specify a way to provide subscriptions on profile modifications so that external systems can retrieve the profile modifications.

The flow looks like this :
Real Event --> Source -> Mapping -> Profile

Profile merges are optional in the CDP specification. They may be supported by using a property defined as an identifier as a merge key (multiple merge keys may of course exist) to merge multiple profiles. The resulting merged profile MUST contain all the source profile IDs of the merged profiles as well as the merged profile data. The original profiles that were merged may be flagged or deleted, this is implementation specific.

=== Events
Events are what drives the Customer Data Platform forward.
Events are collected from different Clients, such as a specific website, beacons, commerce systems or a CRM.

A single Client might still produce many different profiles for a "real person".
For instance - if a visitor uses different devices on a single web page, each device will produce a new profile, with a unique profileID.

As such, Customer Data Platforms implementations SHOULD support profile merges.

As profiles evolve over time, the Customer Data Platform may discover that two profiles actually represent the same individual i.e. if the same e-mail address is registered in both profiles, or if the user in on both his devices. This may then result in a profile merge.
During a profile merge, the Customer Data Platform will link two (or more) separate profiles together.
In order to keep event history and avoid re-processing of data, the merge process must not affect the existing and unique profileIDs.
This is why profiles are defined to have multiple profileIDs.

Example: As such, when visitors on a website are tracked through a cookie (defining the profileID), the cookie will remain the same even if the profile is merged.

The Customer Data Platform is essentially interested in "User behavioral events".
An event could be anything from someone clicking a link, to performing a transaction or consenting to use of his/hers information.
Events are streamed or delivered from authorized <<Clients>> to the Customer Data Platform.

As an example: Imagine an e-commerce site with a client that collect events from its visitors.
When a visitor browses the site with his laptop, the client assigns a cookie to his/her browser and starts feeding events to the CDP API.
As the visitor click on some product links, and maybe fills in a form that includes e-mail. CDP will gradually populate a profile, using the cookie value as an ID.
At a later point, the same visitor picks up a different device and returns to the site. As the client cannot know this is the same individual, a new cookie is generated, and a new profile starts to build up.

A single client may be used to track <<Events>> from a number of different websites, where each website can be tagged with a source.
Sources provide a way to identify the exact origin of the events beyond the client.
As such, sources are comparable to siteID's in Google Analytics.

=== EventTypes

An event must be of a specific type.
EventTypes are implementation specific, with the exception of the standard EventTypes.

The API must include all EventTypes that are available for the specific CDP implementation.
Implementers are encouraged to make EventTypes pluggable, for flexibility.

It is recommended that pluggable EventTypes are registered with a prefix, to avoid naming conflicts.

Here are examples of custom EventTypes:

  pageID : String,
  pageUrl : String,

TODO Cleanup the list of example event types

Example event types include :

- Updating profile properties, needs to match the profile properties definitions
- Updating consent ( see http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm )
- Transaction (generic)
- Like (âuser likes a productâ)
- Dislike (âvisitor dislikes a commentâ)
- Abuse, âuser reports abuse on a pageâ

=== Consents

New legislation and stricter rules for use of personal data is already here (i.e. GDPR).
As such, consents are inherently more important to ensure you are using and storing data in compliance with policies.

Consents hold an identifier that uniquely identifies the consent across your systems.

Consents are given and revoked through events. This means that the CDP specification defines reserved property types for granting and revoking consents.

TODO:

[source,graphql]
----
Do Not Track is a special case, because it cannot be handled using the content management since we cannot
track the user connect to the context server in any way. In this case, profile ID cookies should never be
generated, and each new request will be treated as a separate visit.

Tracking is seperated from cookie identification. For example we could have a form that has an opt-in checkbox
to "remember" the user, but NOT tracking his behavior, so that when he fills another form, pre-fill could happen,
or a single form submission could be handled.

    https://onetrust.com/nobody-likes-cookie-pop-ups-browser-based-consent-eprivacy-regulation/

Can we leverage OAuth 2 autorization scopes here ? Consent types are very similar to OAuth 2 authorization scopes.

Examples:
{
  sourceId : "jahia.com",
  type: {name:"send-to-salesforce"},
  grant: ALLOW
  grantDate : 3498734899
  # no revoke date means it will not expire or defaults to system or legal standard (GDPR)
}
{
  sourceId : "jahia.com",
  type : {name:"newsletter-subscription-latestNews"},
  grant: DENY
  grantDate : 3498734899
  # no revoke date means it will not expire or defaults to system or legal standard (GDPR)
}

Consent Types may include:
- tracking
- list membership
- newsletter membership
- access to camera
- access to friends / contacts data
- access to medical records
- send sms
- call you
- send personal data to third parties
- send anonymous data to third parties

CXS Consent types include:
- allow tracking
-
(for GDPR controllers / processors ?)

Consent types are not defined in the specification, only the format of the type identifier
should use a URI convention. Some URIs could actually be URLs and point to real resource that would give the
semantics of the consent type. Types are not globally unique, a combination of view and types are globally unique
and context server implementations may use "global" or "system" views to share types.

=== Interests

An important use-case for the Customer Data Platform is to determine a profiles "Interests".
Whenever the Customer Data Platform registers an events that are associated with one or more <<Topics>>, this will affect the profile's interest for the specific Topic.
A profiles interest in a specific topic is measured between 0-1, where 1 is maximum. As such 0,5 would indicate a higher interest than 0,35.

The algorithm for how a Customer Data Platform scores and interest is implementation specific
- but implementations should also take care of automatically decreasing interest over time, unless new and relevant events occur.

Example interests for products from a car manufacturer might be:

*  Model S = 0.1
*  Model 3 = 0.3
*  Model X = 0.9


==== CDP_Interest

=== Filters

Filters are widely used in CDP, and enable querying profiles, events, and other CDP objects.
Filters are designed to be easy to use for administrators and marketeers in visual user interfaces, but also in terms of technical implementation.

Filters are essentially composed from basic property comparison expressions, and may be chained with the operators AND and OR, where AND is used by default.

A single filter may only operate on a specified CDP object (i.e. profile or event).

The following comparison operators are available:

.Operator availability for property value types
[options="header"]
|=============================================================
|Operators |Identifier|String|Int|Float|Date|Boolean|GeoPoint|
|equals    |x         |x     |x  |x    |x   |x      |x       |
|startsWith|          |x     |   |     |    |       |        |
|endsWith  |          |x     |   |     |    |       |        |
|contains  |          |x     |   |     |    |       |        |
|regexp*   |          |x     |   |     |    |       |        |
|lt        |          |      |x  |x    |x   |       |        |
|lte       |          |      |x  |x    |x   |       |        |
|gt        |          |      |x  |x    |x   |       |        |
|gte       |          |      |x  |x    |x   |       |        |
|distance  |          |      |   |     |    |       |x       |
|between*  |          |      |x  |x    |x   |       |        |
|=============================================================

* optional operators

As we are expressing filters through GraphQL, filters will always be strongly typed.
I.e. if the property "firstName" with valueType string is available, the following options can be used:

  firstName_equals
  firstName_startsWith
  firstName_endsWith
  firstName_contains
  firstName_regexp (optional)

Below are some basic filter examples:

  { "firstName_equals" : "Serge" }

  { "birthDate_greaterThan" : "1970-01-01" }

  { "location_distance" : {
    "center" : { "longitude" : 59.91273, "latitude": 10.74609 },
    "unit" : "KILOMETERS",
    "distance" : 5
    }
  }

  {
    "or" : [
      { "firstName_equals" : "Serge" },
      { "birthDate_greaterThan" : "1970-01-01" }
    ]
  }

==== Ordering

OrderBy is used in combination with filters and lets you sort the result based on properties available for the returned objects.

Example:

  "orderBy": [{
    "property": "firstName",
    "order": "ASC"
    }
  ]

==== EventFilters

EventFilters are a specific version of filters for querying events.

Example: Filter for identifying events of type `transaction` within the last 30 days.

  {
    "properties" : {
        "timestamp_between" : { "after" : "2018-06-28T05:25:28+00:00", "before" : "2018-06-28T06:25:28+00:00", includeBefore : false, includeAfter : true },
        "cdp_UpdateProfile" : {
          "updateProperties": {
            "firstName_startsWith" : "T"
            "lastName_endsWith" : "d"
          }
        }
    },
    "eventOccurrence": { "eventId": "transaction",   "count": 1,  "afterTime": "now-30d" }}
  }

=== Views

Views provide a way of grouping administrative objects in the Customer Data Platform.
<<Profiles>>, <<Events>> and <<Consents>> are all collected and stored globally,
but other items are typically handled by administrators or marketeers, and benefit from being grouped into different views to simplify handling.

<<Lists>>, <<Segments>>, <<Topics>> and <<Personas>> are all tagged with Views.

----

==== CDP_Mutation

----
include::{sourcedir}/schemas/views.js[lines=32..33]
----



=== Personas

A persona is a concept used by marketeers to visualize one or more target customers, and simplify personalization and targeting of content.

In CDP, personas are essentially "dummy" profiles with the primary purpose of testing or emulating a real profile.
A common use-case would be testing personalized content in a CMS or a newsletter.

Personas and their fields can be explicitly created, where real profiles are built from a stream of events.

----

==== CDP_Mutation

[source,graphql]
----
include::{sourcedir}/schemas/personas.js[lines=35..36]
----


=== Lists

Lists are explicitly created and named in the Customer Data Platform. Profiles may then be added to a list, and later opt out if desired.
Whenever a profile opts out of a list, that information will also be stored. This prevents the profile from accidentally being added back to the list at a later point.

A common use-case for lists is creating a list for a campaign, and add the target profiles to the list as the campaign starts.

==== CDP_List

[source,graphql]
----
include::{sourcedir}/schemas/lists.js[lines=2..8]

=== Segments

Segments are similar to lists in that profiles may be in the segment, or not.
However, where profiles are explicitly added to lists, they are dynamically resolved to segments based on the filter defined in the segment.

Administrative users define segments through <<Filters>>.

Example segments:
* Rich europeans: Profiles in Europe with income above â¬100k
* Frequent buyer: Profiles that have completed more than 5 transactions in the last 3 months
* Etc

=== Topics

Topics represent the core entities of the business that is using the Customer Data Platform.
The Customer Data Platform aims to find correlation between profiles and the topics.
When such correlations are identified, it is called <<Interests>>.

CDP Administrators need to maintain a list of topics in order to obtain profile interests.
Profile interests is typically a core objective of Marketing activities, and targeting users with better content.

Example Topics for a car manufacturer might for instance be:

* "Model S"
* "Model 3"
* "Model X"

== Security Considerations

TODO REMOVE: (Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that could affect security when implementing their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.
While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF \[RFC3552] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks
We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations, IETF \[RFC3552], for more information.)
