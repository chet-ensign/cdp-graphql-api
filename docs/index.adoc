== Introduction

Today, virtually all business is at some point digital, and the number of systems involved and the set of data collected is growing rapidly.
Each new system creates new silos of customer data, spreading sensitive and personal data across both organizational and geographical borders.

Even the digital savvy businesses struggle to control and utilize this information.
Businesses and users also rely on such data to be accessible in real-time, and at scale - for instance to deliver personalizations.
Additionally businesses now face severe legal charges if customer data is not treated according to regulatory requirements (ref GDPR).

The Context Server (CXS) specification aims to standardize exchange of customer data across systems and silos.
This enables centralization of customer data - consequently giving control of the data back to the business, and the customers.

The CXS standard builds upon four core concepts: Profiles, Events, Consents, and Clients

  * Profiles represent each individual "customer". Aggregating and tracking all registered properties, including which system actually collected the data.
  * Events represent user behavioral data / interactions performed by a customer (aka profile). A purchase, or a simple click on a link represents different events.
  * Consents are actual permission given by a customer to the organization, with a limited View and duration
  * Clients represent the various systems that provide and/or consume data from a Context Server, typical clients are: CRM systems, Identity Systems, Content Management Systems, E-commerce etc.

The CXS standard is defined as a web-based API using GraphQL - providing an auto-documented and strongly typed interface.

It has been an explicit goal of the CXS committee to allow extensive customization of CXS deployments, in order to fit the need of each different organization.
As such, the API dynamically evolves as you add custom property-, event-, and consent-types to your deployment.

== Domain Model
This chapter describes the entities of the CXS domain model, and how they relate


=== Clients

Client means any software that interacts directly with the Context Server.
A Context Server likely holds sensitive and personal data, as such implementers are urged to place strong control over which clients can connect to a context server.
It should not be possible for unauthorized clients to access the context server API.

Examples of clients are:

* A cookie-based tracker for your website(s)
* An integration with your CRM
* An integration with your Identity System

A Context Server requires <<profileIDs>> to be unique within a client.
For instance, if a client is used to track visitors across multiple websites, it should re-use the same profileID across all of them, for the same visitor.

NOTE: The standard does not specify Queries or Mutations for creating or retrieving Clients in the CXS specification, as this is considered an implementation-specific feature.
For any CXS implementation, a Client must be pre-defined in the CXS server before it can access the API.



=== Profiles
Profiles are in many ways what CXS is about. A Context Server dynamically builds profiles from events that occur over time.

A Profile can be created from an anonymous visitor on a webpage, or populated from an identity system or maybe a CRM - or the combination of all of them.

Different <<Clients>> like a website tracking script, CRM or identity system can be configured to feed <<Events>> to the context server.
Each Client is responsible for uniquely identifying users, for instance through the use of a cookie on the website, a customer ID in the CRM or a user ID in the Identity system.

The context server is responsible for building profiles based on the provided identifiers and the stream of events coming from each Client.

A Profile consists of the following fields:

* <<ProfileIDs>> - list of IDs associated with this profile
* <<Events>> - events associated with this profile
* <<Segments>> - access segment this profile is active in
* <<Interests>> - Scored list of topics the profile is interested in
* <<Lists>> - Lists the profile is active in
* <<Consents>> - Consents given by the profile
* <<Properties>> - In compliance with the <<ProfilePropertyTypes>> schema

=== Properties

Properties are dynamically defined data fields that can hold a single value, or an array of values.
Each property have a specific valueType, such as Identifier, String, Int, Float, Date, Boolean, GeoPoint or Set.

Some example properties:

* someString : "Thomas"
* someDate : date(1975-10-17)
* someInteger : 1624
* location : geoPoint(x,y)
* arrayOfStrings : ["This", "is", "nice"]
* setOfProperties : {prompt : "hello", response : "yo"}

The valueType Set is special, as it enables nested properties and a document-structure of properties.
The end result should be considered a flat key-value structure.

Using <<Filters>>, nested properties can be referenced through the use of dots.
I.e. from the example above: setOfProperties.response would hold the value "yo"

=== PropertyTypes

PropertyTypes are used to dynamically define schemas in the Context Server.
This is in particular useful as new datatypes can be added or removed through the API.

Since the CXS api is defined using GraphQL, new strongly typed interfaces are also dynamically updated when the schema is changed.

A PropertyType consists of the following fields:

* name (mandatory - unique name within its scope - allowed characters: [_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*
* valueType (Available valueTypes are: Identifier, String, Int, Float, Date, Boolean, GeoPoint or Set)
* minOccur - Specify the minimum number of values
* maxOccur - Specify if there is a maximum amount of values
* tags
* systemTags
* personalData - Specify if this property holds data that can easily identify an individual. This is useful for handling new and strict privacy policies such as GDPR


=== ProfilePropertyTypes

To store property values in profiles, we need a globally defined set of propertyTypes.

Collectively, profilePropertyType defines the schema of properties that can be used by any profile in the Context Server.

This enables administrators and developers to build and maintain a consistent data model for profiles across all <<Clients>>.
Any data imported to the system must be mapped to a corresponding ProfilePropertyType.

A profilePropertyType is technically a PropertyType, where the name must be unique for all profilePropertyTypes.


=== ProfileIDs
Profiles have unique identifiers across different <<Clients>>, and is a composite value from Client and a unique identifier within that Client.

A ProfileID consists of the following fields:

* ID (mandatory - unique within Client)
* Client (mandatory) # ClientID instead?


=== Events
Events are what drives the Context Server forward.
Events are collected from different Clients, such as a specific website, or a CRM.

A single Client might actually produce many different profiles for a "real person".
For instance - if a visitor uses different devices on a single web page, each device will produce a new profile, with a unique profileID.

Context Servers implementations SHOULD support profile merges.
As profiles evolve over time, the context server may discover that two profiles actually represent the same individual i.e. if the same e-mail address is registered in both profiles, or if the user in on both his devices. This may then result in a profile merge.
During a profile merge, the Context Server will link two (or more) separate profiles together.
In order to keep event history and avoid re-processing of data, the merge process must not affect the existing and unique profileIDs.
This is why profiles are defined to have multiple profileIDs.

Example: If visitors on a website are tracked, using a cookie (defining the profileID), the cookie will remain the same even if the profile is merged.

A Context Server is essentially interested in "User behavioral events".
An event could be anything from someone clicking a link, to performing a transaction or consenting to use of his/hers information.
Events are delivered from authorized <<Clients>> to the Context Server.

As an example: Imagine an e-commerce site with a client that collect events from its visitors.
When a visitor browses the site with his laptop, the client assigns a cookie to his/her browser and starts feeding events to the CXS API.
As the visitor click on some product links, and maybe fills in a form that includes e-mail. CXS will gradually populate a profile, using the cookie value as an ID.
At a later point, the same visitor picks up a different device and returns to the site. As the client cannot know this is the same individual, a new cookie is generated, and a new profile starts to build up.

TODO::: Should sources be a separate object, related to client or not???

Clients, may collect <<Events>> from different sources.
For instance, a single client may be used to track events from a number of different websites, where each website is considered a source.
Sources provide a way to identify the exact origin of the events beyond the client.
As such, sources can be compared to siteID's in Google Analytics.


Events consist of the following fields:

* ID (mandatory)
* eventType (mandator)
* profileID
* profile
* source - optionally? specify source within client, i.e. a specific website
* object (mandatory) - Reference to a target object for the event, i.e. an SKU, or a link )
* location
* timestamp - Datetime when the event occured
* properties - Any <<Properties>> stored with the event - must match the schema of the EventType

=== EventTypes

To uniquely separate events, an event must be associated with a specific EventType.
EventTypes require a unique name, preferably using a namespace to avoid conflicts i.e. cxs_profileMerge

An EventType consist of the following fields:

* Name (mandatory) - system-wide unique name - allowed characters: [_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*
* Schema (mandatory) - a Set propertyType allowing any number of propertyTypes

=== Consents

New legislation and stricter rules for use of personal data is already here (i.e. GDPR).
As such, consents are inherently more important to ensure you are using and storing data in compliance with policies.

Consents hold an identifier that uniquely identifies the consent across your systems. The

A consent consist of the following fields:

* Name (Mandatory) - String that identifies the consent, i.e. a url or a reverse domain notation org.cxs.newsletter
* Status - one of GRANT, DENY or REVOKED
* StatusDate - Date when status was last updated
* revokeDate - Revocation date, SHOULD have a default value like two years if left blank
* View TODO: Why???
* Source - Identifying the source of this consent? Optionally accessible from Profile?
* Events - All events related to this consent
* Profile - The profile this consent applies to


=== Interests

An important use-case for the Context Server is to determine a profiles "Interests".
Whenever the Context server registers an events that are associated with one or more <<Topics>>, this will affect the profile's interest for the specific Topic.
A profiles interest in a specific topic is measured between 0-1, where 1 is maximum. As such 0,5 would indicate a higher interest than 0,35.

The algorithm for how a context server scores and interest is implementation specific - but implementations should also take care of automatically decreasing interest over time, unless new and relevant events occur.

Example interests for products from a car manufacturer might be:
* Model S = 0.1
* Model 3 = 0.3
* Model X = 0.9

An Interest consist of the following fields:

* Topic
* Profile
* Score
* updated

=== Filters

Filters are widely used in a Context Server to extract a reduced set of items.
Filters were designed to be flexible to implement, but also easy to use for administrators and marketeers in a user interfaces.

The essential boolean operator used to build filters is "AND" or "OR", this is further combined to build nested levels of expressions.

An example filter could be: TODO

An Filter is built up from the following:

* asString ??
* AND (filter)
* OR (filter)
* propertyFilter


A propertyFilter might be (TODO)

firstName_startsWith
firstName_contains
firstName_equals
location_distance




=== Views

Views provide a way of grouping administrative objects in the context server.
<<Profiles>>, <<Events>> and <<Consents>> are collected and stored globally,
but other items are typically handled by administrators or marketeers, and differ from region to region, or through the various branches of a business.

<<Lists>>, <<Segments>>, <<Topics>> and <<Personas>> are all tagged with Views.

An View consist of the following fields:

* Name (mandatory, unique identifier)


=== Personas

A persona is a concept used by marketeers to visualize one or more target customers, and simplify personalization and targeting of content.

In CXS, personas are essentially "dummy" profiles with the primary purpose of testing or emulating a real profile.
A common use-case would be testing personalized content in a CMS or a newsletter.

Personas and their fields can be explicitly created, where real profiles are built from a stream of events.

A Persona consist of the following fields:

* <<ProfileIDs>> TODO
* View
* <<Segments>> - Specifically selected segments
* <<Interests>> - Specifically defined interests
* <<Lists>> - Specifically defined list memberships
* <<Consents>> - Specifically defined consents
* <<Properties>> - Specifically defined properties

=== Lists

Lists are explicitly created and named in the Context Server. Profiles may then be added to a list, and later opt out if desired.
Whenever a profile opts out of a list, that information will also be stored. This prevents the profile from accidentally being added back to the list at a later point.

A common use-case for lists is creating a list for a campaign, and add the target profiles to the list as the campaign starts.

A List consists of the following fields:

* ID (mandatory)
* Title (mandatory string)
* View
* Profiles - Active profiles in the list
* Inactive - Profiles that have been deactivated

=== Segments

Segments are similar to lists in that profiles may be in the segment, or not.
However, where profiles are explicitly added to lists, they are dynamically resolved to segments based on the filter defined in the segment.

Administrative users define segments through <<Filters>>.

Example segments:
* Rich europeans: Profiles in Europe with income above €100k
* Frequent buyer: Profiles that have completed more than 5 transactions in the last 3 months
* Etc

A Segment consist of the following fields:

* ID (mandatory)
* Title (mandatory string)
* View
* Filter (mandatory)
* Exclude - optional array of profiles to exclude from segment (IDea from TSI)
* Profiles - directly access all profiles in the segment


=== Topics

Topics represent the core entities of the business running the Context Server.
The Context Server aims to find correlation between profiles and the topics.
When such correlations are identified, it is called <<Interests>>.

CXS Administrators need to maintain a list of topics in order to obtain profile interests.
Profile interests is typically a core objective of Marketing activities, and targeting users with better content.

Example Topics for a car manufacturer might for instance be:
* "Model S"
* "Model 3"
* "Model X"

A Topic consist of the following fields:

* ID (generated??) TODO ? Should this be the "key"? I.e. sync/import from external system
* Title (mandatory??)
* View



== API

CXS defines a standard API based on GraphQL.

The CXS GraphQL API is not intended to be exposed publicly, but only made accessible to specific authorized clients.
